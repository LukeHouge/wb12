1. What is the difference between a bump map and a normal map?

Normal maps change the XYZ and bump maps change only the "height". Normal maps give more control, but bump maps are convenient. 

2. What is the difference between a "correct skybox" and simply putting a big cube around the world?

A proper skybox moves with the camera and is always centered at the camera. If you just make a big box that does not move you can move closer to the edges and the effect is not as realistic.

3. Why is a sphere a good object for environment mapping, but a flat square is less good?

Because the every point on the sphere has a different normal vector and will cause a different reflection. With a flat square all points on a face will have the same normal and reflect the same thing. If the cube is small and the eye is far it could look ok, but curvy objects are better.

4. What are the main choices for how to represent environment map images? Why might you pick one or the other?

Cube maps and sphere maps (equirectangular) are the most common. Each has issues sampling in different places. However, sphere maps can be more convenient to capture with a camera. Cube maps however look nicer when viewing, and map nicer to the graphics hardware.
